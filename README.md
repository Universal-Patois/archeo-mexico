# Archeo-Mexico

To create an application with React that includes a map of Mexico with clickable states and pins that show the location of archaeological sites, you will need to use several APIs and technologies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Map API: You will need to use a Map API such as Google Maps API, Mapbox, or Leaflet to display the map of Mexico.

2. GeoJSON data: To display the state boundaries of Mexico, you will need GeoJSON data for Mexico that includes state boundaries. You can use a publicly available dataset, such as the one provided by Natural Earth.

3. Clickable state functionality: You can use the React-Leaflet library to create clickable state functionality on the map. This library allows you to add interactive layers to the map that respond to user clicks.

4. Archaeological sites data: You will need to obtain data on archaeological sites in Mexico. There are several publicly available datasets you can use, such as the Archaeological Sites in Mexico dataset provided by the National Institute of Anthropology and History.

5. Pin markers: To display the location of archaeological sites on the map, you will need to add pin markers. You can use the Leaflet library to add markers to the map.

6. Backend API: Depending on how you want to store and access the archaeological sites data, you may need to set up a backend API. You can use a serverless solution like Firebase or AWS Lambda, or a more traditional server setup.

7. Database: If you decide to set up a backend API, you will need to store the archaeological sites data in a database. You can use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or a relational database like PostgreSQL.

8. Authentication: If you want to restrict access to certain parts of your application, such as adding new archaeological sites, you will need to set up authentication. You can use a service like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication to handle authentication.
